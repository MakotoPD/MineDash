## Changes (v0.3.8)

### ⚡ Performance & Fixes
- **Tray Menu Optimization**: Replaced constant polling with a reactive watcher. The tray menu now only updates when server status actually changes, significantly reducing background activity.
- **RAM Reporting Fix**: Fixed an issue where memory usage was being double-counted recursively, leading to incorrect values (e.g. 100GB+). Now correctly tracks unique process IDs.

## Changes (v0.3.7)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Linux Java Download**: Fixed an issue where downloading Java on Linux failed with "unsupported archive format: gz". Added support for `.tar.gz` extraction.
- **Dark Mode**: Fixed inconsistent dark theme application for Modals and Toasts.

## Changes (v0.3.6)

### ✨ Features & Improvements
- **Enhanced Java Detection**: The `Auto-Detect` feature now intelligently scans the application's local data directory. Java versions downloaded via VoidLink are now automatically discovered and configured without manual path selection.
- **Better Installation Feedback**: Added clear visual feedback during Java installation, including exact download paths and success/failure system notifications (Toasts).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Linux/Tray Logic**: Fixed a race condition that prevented the application from closing correctly on Linux (and other platforms) when "Minimize to Tray" was disabled.

### 📦 Maintenance
- **Internal**: Updated Rust-side detection logic to support app-local Java paths.
